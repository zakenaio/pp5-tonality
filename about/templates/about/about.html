                <p class=" mb-0 text-left">How it started. </p>

                <p class="p-3">
                    Tonality was born from a shared passion for music and a frustration with the
                    limitations of the mainstream industry. We envisioned a platform to share our love for rare and
                    classic sounds, <em>a space where music could truly resonate.</em></p>

                <p class="mt-3 p-3">
                    Anders "uFo", a record collector with an insatiable curiosity for hidden gems, found
                    himself yearning for a deeper connection with music. Surrounded by vinyl stacks in his small town,
                    Anders embarked on a mission to create a haven for music enthusiasts like himself. Thus, Tonality
                    was born â€“ a record store that rapidly transformed into a sanctuary for those seeking more than the
                    latest hits.
